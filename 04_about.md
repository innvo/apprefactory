The AppRefactory.  “A Software Factory for modernizing monolithic legacy applications”.  The AppRefactory takes existing legacy systems and refactors them into modern, robust & flexible cloud native applications using systematic and proven processes.   Our unique approach allows the legacy system and the new refactored applications to be run and tested in parallel, significantly reducing risks and avoiding business interruptions. The new applications are easily portable to cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google Cloud.
